input:

    head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

    head = 1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5 <- 6 <- 7

    1

    []

    1 -> 2 -> 3
    1 <- 2 <- 3

out:
           1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5 <- 6 <- 7 = head
 

O(n) requirement:

This means we should be able to accomplish this by scanning from left to right


if head is null, do nothing

prev = null
curr = head
Iterate through the list
while (current != null)
 // prev: null, 1, 2, 3
 // curr: 1, 2, 3, null
 // following: 2, 3, null

  following = curr.next
  curr.next = prev
  prev = curr
  curr = following

head = prev

  

where we are
what _should_ be next in the unadulterated version of the list
For each item,
  Reset the following item's "next pointer" to point to us
Set the new head of the list to the be the item
